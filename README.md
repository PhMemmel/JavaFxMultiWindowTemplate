# JavaFX multi window project template

This is a sample project on how to deal with multiple windows in JavaFX. Switching between
multiple windows is being handled by a WindowManager singleton object more or less implementing 
the state pattern: current state equals currently shown window.

Project configuration is based on https://github.com/PhMemmel/GradleJavaFxTemplate
